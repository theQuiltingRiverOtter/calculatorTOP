# calculatorTOP

 Built for the foundations course in the Odin Project. We were to design a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions. It needed to be able to  string several operations together. It needed to clear the screen, round long decimals, display an error if divide by 0, and deal with pressing = when you don't have a full function in. My calculator met these challenges. I was also able to add decimals and a backspace function. I used Bulma for the design because I wanted to practice using a web ui framework. It came out okay, but still not perfect. I also tried to add keyboard functionality. I was able to do this partway. The number row and number pad works, but only the operators on the number pad and the ones you don't need to press 'shift' to get are working. I would like to figure out how to get all of the operators along the top row working.
